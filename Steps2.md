This is the second attempt at Conway's Game of Life in Angular 20. This time I have modified the prompt to not include standard functions that are no longer part of Angular 20.
Prompt: 
```
Create an Angular 20 program that will allow internationalization with color themes based on the language chosen. It will have a grid with options to increase it's width and height separately. This grid will dynamically resize to stay within a constrained area. The state of the grid will be recorded, and it will support single step, running and stopping. It will also support randomly setting cells in the grid. The state of each cell will be determined by an algorithm that checks each of the neighboring cells. The code must not contain APP_INITIALIZER, ENVIRONMENT_INITIALIZER, PLATFORM_INITIALIZER, bind-, on-m bindon-, ref-, defineInjectable, bootstrapModuleFactory, ApplicationRef.bootstrap, async, entryComponents or ANALYZE_FOR_ENTRY_COMPONENTS
```
This took approximately 3 hours of back-and-forth to get working. This does not include grid resizing - that will come later.
